***
### h3 Description
***
I used this free HTML [Destino Template](https://colorlib.com/preview/#destino) for creating theme.
***
Admin can change almost everything: from headers to theme colors. Added many new features. The theme is adaptive for all modern displays. It has 7 different types of pages, each of which has its own advantages. A lot of things have not yet been completed, as the project is in the beginning stage.
***
### h3 Homepage
***
The Homepage has a large number of settings (metaboxes) in which you can literally change everything: headers, number of sections, images, content sections and much more. The page uses a special header which contains the main menu, company slogans (if you wish, you can remove it) and the search form. Afterwards there is section with offers, section with last minute offers, video if necessary, excursions section, and sections with locations of offers. All these fields can be customized as you wish.

### h3 Offers & Excursions
***
One type pages. Ð¡ontain posts about excursions and offers. They are very similar to each other, but contain a different content. Offers are more diverse, therefore we will consider them. Offers have two custom taxonomies: location (the city in which hotel is based) and stars (from 0.5 to 5). If desired, you can add slider and map.

### h3 News
***
This page displays posts. Only News page have sidebar. Sidebar has a special search exclusively for news, 3 recent entries, and section with last minute offers. News is also the only commentable page.
